# MG AFK Android

MG AFK Android is a lightweight, read-only mobile app that lets you stay
connected to Magic Garden without launching the game. It keeps a session open
to display pet ability logs, shop inventory, weather and more while minimizing
battery usage. No in-game actions are performed.

## How it works

MG AFK connects to the game's WebSocket endpoint and authenticates using your
Discord account. Incoming data is parsed and displayed across dedicated
sections (dashboard, pets, shops, alerts).

## Login

Tap **Login with Discord** in the Dashboard. A browser window opens on
Discord's OAuth page — log in and the app captures your session token
automatically. The token is stored persistently so you only need to log in
once.

To log out, tap **Logout**. This clears the stored token.

## Navigation

Swipe from the left edge or tap the hamburger menu to open the navigation
drawer. Sections:

| Section | Content |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard | Connection setup + live status |
| Pets | Pet hunger bars + ability logs |
| Shops | Current seed / tool / egg / decor inventory |
| Alerts | Notification config (shops, weather, pets) |

Sections that require an active connection are greyed out when offline.

## Multiple accounts

MG AFK supports multiple sessions. Use the tabs bar to add a new account (+)
and switch between sessions. Each tab keeps its own login, room code, and
reconnect settings.

## Alerts

MG AFK can notify you about shop restocks, weather changes, and low pet
hunger. Toggle individual items in the Alerts section.

## Build

Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (latest stable)
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 35

Open the project in Android Studio and run on a device/emulator, or build from
the command line:
